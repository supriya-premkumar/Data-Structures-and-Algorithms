/**
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of 1 bits it has.

 Example:

 The 32-bit integer 11 has binary representation

 00000000000000000000000000001011
 so the function should return 3.

 Note that since Java does not have unsigned int, use long for Java

        int count = 0;
        while(a > 0){
            if(a % 2 == 1)
                count++;
